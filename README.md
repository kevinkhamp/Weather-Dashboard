## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery

## Usage For Project

Open the deployed link or live server and search a city for their weather.

## Issues

While I was using JQuery to do this assignment, I ran into some hurdles in trying to re-search a past city. The searchAgain function would only duplicate a search instead of targeting each individual button. I believe it was cause of my approach. Also, adding to local storage.

## Credit

YouTube tutorials have helped me through various parts of the challenge... for the most part.
